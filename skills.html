  <!-- In order to accieve the goal of the challange displayed in the course we have to use a method called nesting
    we can nest a table within another table to achive the goal the above code is NOT AN EXAMPLE OF TABLE nesting
    we changed it back in order to make things simpler! Nesting is not used due to inefficiency and maintainability
    this is why we do not use HTML in order to design websites an dwe use CSS in order to keep things simpler and
    easy to maintian in the long run. -->
